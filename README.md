## Back with Another DOM Project! ðŸŽ‰

After my "Guess My Number" game, I've leveled up my JavaScript skills by diving deeper into DOM manipulation. This time, I interacted more with classes, used querySelectorAll, and implemented a simple modal feature triggered by the keyup event. Here's what I've been up to:

### What I Learned

**DOM Interaction:**

* `querySelector` vs. `querySelectorAll`: Understanding the difference between selecting a single element and multiple elements.
* Event Listeners: Adding event listeners to multiple elements efficiently.
* Class Manipulation: Toggling classes to show and hide elements.

**Key Features:**

* Modal Window: A pop-up modal that can be opened and closed with buttons and the escape key.
* Overlay: An overlay that dims the background when the modal is open.
* Keyboard Events: Handling global keyboard events to enhance user interaction.


I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and can't wait to tackle more projects! Stay tuned for more updates and happy coding! ðŸš€
